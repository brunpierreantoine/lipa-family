# Project-Local Agents

This directory contains IDE-agnostic, version-controlled agents for the `lipa-family` project. These agents provide specialized assistance for UX reviews and frontend implementation.

## Available Agents

| Agent Name | File | Aliases | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Product Owner / PRD** | [product-owner-prd.md](product-owner-prd.md) | `po`, `prd`, `product`, `requirements` | Transforms vague requests into actionable, testable PRDs using `requirements-clarity`. |
| **UX Reviewer** | [ux-reviewer.md](ux-reviewer.md) | `ux`, `mobile-ux`, `design-review` | Mobile-first UX reviews focused on conversion and clarity. |
| **Frontend Implementer** | [frontend-implementer.md](frontend-implementer.md) | `fe`, `implementer`, `frontend` | Senior Next.js engineer for implementing approved changes. |
| **Debugger / Lint Fixer** | [debugger-lint-fixer.md](debugger-lint-fixer.md) | `debug`, `lint`, `fixer`, `bugfix` | Diagnosing and fixing runtime, TypeScript, and ESLint errors. |

## How to Use

You can invoke these agents in natural language by referring to their name or aliases.

**Rule of Thumb:**
If your request starts with "I want..." and isn't already a clear spec, run the **Product Owner / PRD** agent first. When requirements are vague, route to **Product Owner** or request a PRD pass before implementation.

**Example Prompts:**

1. **Phase 1: Clarification**
   - "Hey **prd**, I want to add a social sharing feature but I'm not sure about the details. Please run a `requirements-clarity` pass."
2. **Phase 2: Execution**
   - "Ask the **frontend-implementer** to implement the 'Social Sharing' feature based on the PRD generated by the Product Owner."

**Other Examples:**

- "Ask the **ux-reviewer** to look at the new landing page design."
- "Hey **fe**, please implement the changes suggested in the UX review."
- "Run a **design-review** on the user settings component."

## Documentation Tasks

Documentation-related tasks (e.g., creating or improving READMEs) should be handled by:

- **Frontend Implementer:** When the documentation is implementation-adjacent.
- **Product Owner:** When the documentation involves product specs or requirements.
- Explicitly requesting documentation work using the `crafting-effective-readmes` skill.

## Skill Discovery

These agents rely on globally installed skills located in `~/.agents/skills/` (including `requirements-clarity`). They dynamically discover relevant skills using the `find-skills` tool when needed.
